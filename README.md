# Travel Destinations

A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.

# Organization

My travel list is organized by state with lists of places I'd like to go in each state. 

# Future Plans

I want to make the following updates:
1. Add all states I haven't visited 
2. Add wishslists to all states
3. Add states I have visited with lists of places I have been in those states but remove background color to keep the emphasis on places I haven't visited
4. Change animation so when hovering over the state's name floats to the top of the box and the wishlist is displayed centered below

# Bigger Ambitions

This probably isn't going to happen but I can dream, right?
5. Enable real-time permanent updates so I can mark states as visited, add places I have visited, add places I want to visit
6. Allow other people to submit suggestions for places I should visit in different states
7. Let people upvote or downvote other people's suggestions
8. Add a US map below that displays which states I have been to and which states I haven't been to like the Interactive Visited States Map I have been obsessed with lately
